To get started, first you will need to replace $servername, $username, and $password in both index.php and dbinit.php to your correct credentials. Then start up a php server at localhost (php -S localhost:8080). Then navigate to http://localhost:8080/dbinit.php which will create the proper tables/columns for use with the assignment. Finally, just go to http://localhost and everything should be working properly.

Notes:

I wasn’t quite sure at first whether or not I should be using pure PHP, or a combination with javascript. I tried to do as much implementation with PHP as possible, but I still ended up relying on JS some. If there’s anything I did incorrectly, feel free to let me know, I’m always looking for ways to improve.
